###### Self training on C++ coding.


Some ideas:
 * pointers and references - smart pointers
 * auto
 * templates
 * type casting
 * standard library - selected topics - will be trickling in through the examples
 
initialization_ex: Initialization of variables of various types. 

functional_ex: Standard library feature for working with functions.

references_ex*: Handling of references, pointers, dynamic memory
allocation etc.

templates/: Generic programming - coding with templates and applying
Standard Template Library.

classes/: Basic classes examples - abstraction.

smartpointers/: Standard library pointer support, aka smart pointers as
opposed to raw pointers. Automated handling of pointers and scope, avoiding memory
leaks.

threads/: Standard library thread support - builds on pthreads. 
Standard library future and async.
